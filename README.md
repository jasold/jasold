Hi, everybody
I hope all the members are in a good health. As my pseudo shows it, I am not too young, eighty years only, but anytime, in the past, I did my work  in electronics, informatic later.
Today, Grand Daddy is helping his grand son, so, I spend all my day in learning. That's why, I am here and happy to share.
Good luck
